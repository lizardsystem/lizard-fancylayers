Changelog of lizard-fancylayers
===================================================


0.3 (unreleased)
----------------

- If a popup is shown for several identifiers at once, they are now
  shown as separate graphs, instead of all timeseries in the same
  graph. Mainly because the combined graphs got very messy once
  percentiles were involved.


0.2 (2012-12-20)
----------------

- Add support for percentiles, colors.


0.1 (2012-11-15)
----------------

Not really working yet, but making a release for test purposes.
