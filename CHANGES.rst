Changelog of lizard-fancylayers
===================================================


0.7 (2013-04-10)
----------------

- Make it possible to show several timeseries from one location in one
  graph. Doesn't look nice yet.


0.6 (2013-03-19)
----------------

- Hiding the legend if there's no proper legend to be found.

- Fixed icon before popup graph title.


0.5 (2013-02-12)
----------------

- Implement a legend() function using lizard-datasource's
  location_annotations.


0.4 (2013-01-16)
----------------

- Added a values() method to the adapter, so that CSV files with
  values can be downloaded.

- Show a unit in the popup.

0.3 (2013-01-03)
----------------

- If a popup is shown for several identifiers at once, they are now
  shown as separate graphs, instead of all timeseries in the same
  graph. Mainly because the combined graphs got very messy once
  percentiles were involved.


0.2 (2012-12-20)
----------------

- Add support for percentiles, colors.


0.1 (2012-11-15)
----------------

Not really working yet, but making a release for test purposes.
